# Welcome
Here you can find some stuff I programmed make some things work faster

# How to install
1. Install Autohotkey [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download my Repository [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/MaxiAmZocken/My-Stuff)
3. Run the file and edit it how you like

*Bonus : You can add it to your startup folder (press `Win+R` and type `shell:startup`) to run it automatically on boot*

# Information

The Scipt was created for my computer, which has 2 Monitors, this is pretty important for the discord Scripts, because of the coordinates

Everything should work fine, because the coordinates are bound to the window, but I can't guarantee for anything
